              <h2>This was...</h2>
<p>This was the 72 in the hundred days of python from Udemy. This was a really good refresher of how to use Matlab to draw graphs of different types. It was useful to see some good examples of how to format and shape the graph and the images. It was also useful to see some trailing data function</p>
<h2>I already knew...</h2>
<p>The refresher of Matt plot lip functions was helpful
<img  src='/images/Machine_Learning/day_72_graph1.png'></p>
<h2>What was new...</h2>
<p>The insights from the data were quite interesting. It's surprising to see Java has decreased in the number of stack overflow posts since about 2015. It seems most programming languages on stack. Overflow have also decreased from around the 2015 to 16 era.

Peter on the other hand, has continued to escalate during that timeThe time that this chapter was written python was continuing to increase. Since this tutorial is written, have a Python seems to have decreased somewhat. All of the programming languages have decreased a bit, but python has decreased a lot.</p>
<p>Python is still with the head of the others.</p>
<p>It's difficult to know why this is. I wonder if people are mainly using chat GPT instead of stack overflow. Since stack overflow has been fed into chat. GPT you can probably get quicker answers than wading through stack. Overflow yourself. Since python has been used a lot for machine learning and artificial intelligence that people group will be. Most aware of the opportunities presented by chat. GPT and are more likely to leave stack overflow for Chachi PT.</p>
<h2>I particularly liked...</h2>
<p>I particularly liked some of the graphs that you could draw from the data. The grass were very insightful and told you a lot about the popularity of languages and the time frame is over which use of stack overload has increased and decreased. Overall it seems to indicate that use of stack overflow has decreased since around 2016 for all languages. This feels a little bit sad and it is not entirely clear why. Chat bots providing summarised programming. Advice did not really become popularly used in 20 1718 or 19.

I also really like today SQL API at the head of the python notebook. This allowed me to connect the latest data.</p>
<p>Also, I am new to Python Jupiter notebooks. These are really useful tools for exploring data. The opportunity to modify and change your code and have it all presented in one "and "document" seems extremely helpful</p>
