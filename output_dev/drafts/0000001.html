              <p>I recall liking maths at secondary school. 
Cover: /images/apple-touch-icon_thumb.png</p>
<p>I was a middle set candidate. My school did maths one year early. It is hard to get the higher grades on the middle tier papers. And as a middle middle tier candidate I was set for the middle tier papers.</p>
<p>To my surprise and everyone else's I did get the top mark. I was put in to a very high A-level set. My age appears at other schools were still doing the ordinary level paper. But this was too much.</p>
<p>At a level. this was my one a grade. My brother and sister both did double A-level maths. I am a mathematician from a mathematics family. The maths</p>
<p>The maths at university was difficult but I managed it. We stepped well beyond the limits of single maths.</p>
<p>During actual work at engineering the maths used was relatively light compared to degree level. That even includes live thermodynamic calculations of functioning chemical plants.</p>
<p>The maths on the medicine course was very light statistics. There was very little use of the A-level and degree level maths I had learned in engineering. In one situation, a medical statistician had provided a colleague with lots of complex statistics. I felt this was unfair as it was clearly impenetrable to most medical doctors. Deep statistical maths is really not a diagnostic tool, it is more appropriate in a research and public health setting. Clinical practice. Certainly did not use much maths at all.</p>
<p>Machine learning is clearly based on quite a lot of fairly complex maths. I am keen and willing to dive into this, but as I am doing so there are plenty of unknowns to me. With that in mind, I found a Udemy refresher, A-level maths course.</p>
<p>I would like to thank Louis I would like to thank Woody Lowenstein for his excellent Udemy A-level maths course. The pure one course was brilliant and here are a few highlights.</p>
