              <h2>This was...</h2>
<p>This is the all-time classic introduction book to Python and is where I started. I listen to a podcast interview featuring Eric Mathis, who is a teacher. He described learning programming as best done through projects and in this book he gives you three projects.</p>
<p>In the first project you use play game to create a simple arcade space invaders game. This helped me explore the game loop graphic boundaries, high scores and edge cases.</p>
<p>The second project was the use of Matt plot Lib and Webb API is to explore probabilities and statistics. I learned about application programming interfaces graph representation using plot and Matt plot live we also covered installing and loading, separated value data and a dose of probability. This was a nice exploration of additional topics above the opening chapters.</p>
<p>The third project was writing of a learning log using the Django Python web framework by the time I got to this I had already explored the pelican python static blog to it and also SQL alchemy, ginger to templating and Flask. I did not complete this chapter but would love to go back just for the learning.</p>
<h2>I already knew...</h2>
<p>I came to Python mainly knowing some C+ plus having worked through."jumping into C++"by Alex Allain. This previous work taught me a good deal about pointers references, loop structures and important programming basics such as modules, imports and other basic structures. This means when I came to Python and found I did not need to use pointers. I still understood what was going on in the background. I was aware of the need to allocate and delicate memory and what the difference was between a shallow and a deep copy. I feel this substantially improved what I could get from this basic Python introduction.</p>
<h2>What was new...</h2>
<p>I certainly learnt more about using list slices. I learned a bit about using pie game and also Matt plot Lib, plot Lee. I would like to go back and complete the Django work.</p>
<h2>I particularly liked...</h2>
<p>I really liked that. This was a straightforward project based introduction to programming in Python. Note that this was before large language models so all the basic mistakes and error solving I did on my own. I feel this gave me an advantage in learning Python.</p>
