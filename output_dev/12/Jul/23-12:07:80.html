              <p>I was mildly positive about choosing maths and doing maths at A-level. I almost didn't get to do A-levels. At a high performing school that makes you do maths a year early you can be made to run too quickly too fast and failed to make the great to get in where you might actually have some strength.</p>
<p>I had two teachers of maths. This was beneficial. We were able to cover different material and have different teaching styles. I like my maths that it was small and focused and actually I was a strong candidate.</p>
<p>I think my school learnt at self to teaching maths to high level, but you had to be a certain type of person. The matter leads, of which I was not one really seem to understand the parlance very well.</p>
<p>I've all my A-levels maths first one has prepared prepared me for everything else, the best. I certainly do regret not doing double maths, but for me at that time it was not an option.</p>
<p></p></div></p>
<div class='row'><p><img align='right' src="#">
In the end maths was my one a grade. I was quite sad about this. Getting an a in the physics seemed so straightforward. I was surprised that I got a B. In the chemistry I Gotta be I was less surprised about this but also I was quite annoyed.

Looking back on it, the problem with physics and chemistry is both of them required using English language, my native language. Earlier on in my school career, my secondary school had chosen to offer me extra English lessons instead of Latin. My parents have gone with the Latin. The English department was right English was not my strength. I still scored bees but it wasn't the A's that my friend scored.

On reflection, as I doubt it on reflection as an adult, my sentence construction was clumsy wordy and overly complicated. This meant in the one sentence physics and chemistry exam answers. I was prone to write something that was not precise or specific enough. I also had this idea that to demonstrate understanding you had to express the concept in different terms. I became very frustrated with people who could parrot recite phrases and get full marks. I felt it demonstrated no understanding. I missed the point that using a different explanation would be using imprecise terms and therefore might not actually be correct. I fully understood the physics and chemistry. I just was not playing the examination game.

Again later on in life, I came to find this was a feature of my marginal Neurodivergent.
