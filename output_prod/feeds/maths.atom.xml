I almost didn't get to do A-levels. At a high performing school that makes you do maths a year early you can be made to run too quickly too fast and failed to make the great to get in where you might actually have some strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had two teachers of maths. This was beneficial. We were able to cover different material and have different teaching styles. I like my maths that it was small and focused and actually I was a strong candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think my school learnt at self to teaching maths to high level, but you had to be a certain type of person. The matter leads, of which I was not one really seem to understand the parlance very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've all my A-levels maths first one has prepared prepared me for everything else, the best. I certainly do regret not doing double maths, but for me at that time it was not an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='row'&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align='right' src="#"&gt;
In the end maths was my one a grade. I was quite sad about this. Getting an a in the physics seemed so straightforward. I was surprised that I got a B. In the chemistry I Gotta be I was less surprised about this but also I was quite annoyed.

Looking back on it, the problem with physics and chemistry is both of them required using English language, my native language. Earlier on in my school career, my secondary school had chosen to offer me extra English lessons instead of Latin. My parents have gone with the Latin. The English department was right English was not my strength. I still scored bees but it wasn't the A's that my friend scored.

On reflection, as I doubt it on reflection as an adult, my sentence construction was clumsy wordy and overly complicated. This meant in the one sentence physics and chemistry exam answers. I was prone to write something that was not precise or specific enough. I also had this idea that to demonstrate understanding you had to express the concept in different terms. I became very frustrated with people who could parrot recite phrases and get full marks. I felt it demonstrated no understanding. I missed the point that using a different explanation would be using imprecise terms and therefore might not actually be correct. I fully understood the physics and chemistry. I just was not playing the examination game.

Again later on in life, I came to find this was a feature of my marginal Neurodivergent.

&lt;p&gt;This was pure to year two of the A-level maths on Udemy by Woody Lowenstein
&lt;img  src='/images/Maths/pure2_partial_fractions.jpg'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I already knew...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have covered a level maths before and so I knew a good deal of this. The maths I did previously was a little thin, having covered smaller levels of pure maths. This particular chapter was enormous. It covered huge amounts of differentiation and integration.
&lt;img  src='/images/Maths/pure2_trig_addition.jpg'&gt;
There was substantial commitment behind achieving this. We covered huge areas.
&lt;img  src='/images/Maths/p2_harmonic.jpg'&gt;
You should see the link above. There were a substantial number of areas all of which were covered to substantial depth. While I knew some differentiation and integration, the depth that was substantial. The chapter also covered a significant amount of trigonometry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What was new...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The differentiation covered a number of tools for performing differentials of complex functions. Equally, the integration chapter covered, a large number of tools for integrating complex functions and overlapped substantially with trigonometry and binomial expansion. It took quite some time to cover this. The integration chapter alone is four hours.
&lt;img  src='/images/Maths/p2_implicit_differentiation.jpg'&gt;
There is a chapter on parametric equations. I do not recall this at all from A-level maths in 1998.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is however clear that this is part of machine learning and artificial intelligence. This was a nice opening introduction. There was also a section on three-dimensional vectors. This was an extension on two-dimensional vectors from year one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I particularly liked...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img  src='/images/Maths/p2_int_by_parts.jpg'&gt;
I particularly liked how the different chapter areas overlapped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woody has chosen wisely in the order of material and how it is presented. The strength again was the short video followed by the short exercise to reinforce it. This was a great course and I cannot recommend it enough.

&lt;p&gt;This was the Udemy A-level maths PE course for year one or a S level by Woody Lowenstein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I already knew...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have completed A-level maths before. That was when I was 18 and at time of writing this I am 43, so 25 years ago. Since then I've used substantial maths on my engineering degree, much less maths as an engineering practitioner and almost no maths in my medicine career.
&lt;img  src='/images/Maths/p1_integration.jpg'&gt;
None of the material is new to me, but this was completely a refresher. I worked through all of the questions and all of the past papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What was new...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the methods were new to me, and clearly were the starting grounds for some of the higher concepts. You need today in machine learning. There was some useful information about binomial expansion is some new material on trigonometry and a good introduction to vectors.
&lt;img  src='/images/Maths/p1_trig.jpg'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I particularly liked...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I particularly liked the material covering natural log and logarithm graphs. While this was not knew it was covered very well. I would very strongly commend this course. Woodys style is clear and engaging, and also to the point. The short model of a little lecture, followed by a little practice was great at reinforcing the material. I think it is 2nd to none.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Maths"></category><category term="#Maths"></category><category term="#Reflections"></category></entry><entry><title>UK A Level Maths review, Mechanical Maths 1</title><link href="n/00000007.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-06-16T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-03-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>clexp</name></author><id>tag:None,2023-06-16:n/00000007.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;UK A Level Maths review, Mechanical Maths 1&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;This was...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was the Udemy A-level course by Woody Lowenstein covering mechanics 14AS. Maths&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I already knew...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a Masters degree in engineering, this was all very basic. It was fun to go back through it and be reminded what the basics were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What was new...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the A-level courses by Woody Owen Stein, he uses a Casio FX991EX class quiz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was some really nice teaching on how to use this. The Casio manuals are a little bit heavy going and not clear what and why and when.
&lt;img  src='/images/Maths/Mech1_forces.jpg'&gt;
Woodies, instructions and indications were excellent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the lecture would've used the emulator for the calculator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems to work on Windows. I struggle to get this to work on the Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was not able to get a VM that would've run it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img  src='/images/Maths/Mech1_variable_acc.jpg'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I particularly liked...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woody had a nice Mnemonic for learning the equations of constant acceleration. I recall having made mistakes by not using these equations correctly in the past. No more mistakes!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Maths"></category><category term="#Maths"></category><category term="#Reflections"></category></entry><entry><title>UK A Level Maths review, Mechanics Maths 2</title><link href="n/00000008.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-06-16T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-03-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>clexp</name></author><id>tag:None,2023-06-16:n/00000008.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;UK A Level Maths review, Mechanics Maths 2&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;This was...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the mechanics to a level year two course by Woody Lowenstein on you do me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I already knew...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a mechanical engineer, very little is new here. My goal is to learn machine learning and artificial intelligence and at time of writing I have chosen not to pursue this particular video series. I did complete the mechanics one series and felt it added nothing to the knowledge required for machine learning. With a tight time, I will park the mechanics two for another time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What was new...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't comment here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I particularly liked...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot comment here, however, if this is like any of Woodies other videos, the delivery style and pattern of short lecture, followed by exercise is excellent and 2nd to none.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Maths"></category><category term="#Maths"></category><category term="#Reflections"></category></entry><entry><title>UK A Level Maths review, Statistical Maths 1</title><link href="n/00000009.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-06-16T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-03-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>clexp</name></author><id>tag:None,2023-06-16:n/00000009.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;UK A Level Maths review, Statistical Maths 1&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;This was...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the statistics, one or year, one A-level or AS maths on Udemy by Woody Lowenstein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I already knew...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I have done A-level maths previously, my statistical maths was somewhat watered-down at the time. Since then I have done almost no statistical maths during my engineering degree. During medicine, there were nominal approaches to medical statistics, but even with my mathematical ability being better than my peers, this was mostly wasted on me.
&lt;img  src='/images/Maths/stats_one.jpg'&gt;
This was a great opening, introduction to understanding and appreciating data sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What was new...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days the A-levels seem to provide you with data sets. When you are in the exam you are expected to have familiarity with a dataset that you have been presented with in the months previously to the exam. This means you need to have familiarity with the missing data. Tobias is the averages and the standard deviations. While you do not need to recall any numerical facts out right, it helps to have a feel for the dataset.
&lt;img  src='/images/Maths/stats_one_bayes.jpg'&gt;
I thought this was great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woody prevent presents you with data sets from no less than four examining boards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He takes some time to walk through the key features of which you should be aware. At the time of completing this, I felt I would really go and complete the A-level exam.
&lt;img  src='/images/Maths/stats_one_binomial_distribution.jpg'&gt;
This is unnecessary on a pathway to learn machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a great basic introduction to the simple tools for analysing data set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I particularly liked...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, the delivery style was excellent. Further the pattern of short video followed by exercises really stimulated drawing as much as you could from the course. The examination samples were good and the examples worked. Examples were excellent.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Maths"></category><category term="#Maths"></category><category term="#Reflections"></category></entry></feed>
