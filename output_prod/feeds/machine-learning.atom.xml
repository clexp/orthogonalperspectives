&lt;h2&gt;This was...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a review of day 71 on the hundred days of python course through Udemy. This was a review of how to use panders from earlier lectures and chapters. We covered the basics of loading some data and exploring it with the pedestals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I already knew...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was simply revision. There was very little new here. It is a little tricky becoming familiar with the pandas syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What was new...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Anders syntax can be a little tricky. It is not always clear with Meyer. I should use the object model or whether I should use the dictionary model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the data frame is an object, there are lots of powerful features to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img  src='/images/Machine_Learning/day_71_output.png'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I particularly liked...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this lecture, we covered a range of college majors and their subsequent earning potential. It was not a surprise that computer engineering was one of the better paid salaries. At 43, it does make me consider my life choices. While I am paid very well I can't help feeling like there are other good options.
&lt;img  src='/images/Machine_Learning/day_71_code.png'&gt;
This also affected how I feel about my children's future. They are open to choose whatever they want to do, but I can't help but want to nudge them in a direction.

&lt;p&gt;This was the 72 in the hundred days of python from Udemy. This was a really good refresher of how to use Matlab to draw graphs of different types. It was useful to see some good examples of how to format and shape the graph and the images. It was also useful to see some trailing data function&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I already knew...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refresher of Matt plot lip functions was helpful
&lt;img  src='/images/Machine_Learning/day_72_graph1.png'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What was new...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insights from the data were quite interesting. It's surprising to see Java has decreased in the number of stack overflow posts since about 2015. It seems most programming languages on stack. Overflow have also decreased from around the 2015 to 16 era.
&lt;img  src='/images/Machine_Learning/day_72_pivot.png'&gt;
Peter on the other hand, has continued to escalate during that timeThe time that this chapter was written python was continuing to increase. Since this tutorial is written, have a Python seems to have decreased somewhat. All of the programming languages have decreased a bit, but python has decreased a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python is still with the head of the others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's difficult to know why this is. I wonder if people are mainly using chat GPT instead of stack overflow. Since stack overflow has been fed into chat. GPT you can probably get quicker answers than wading through stack. Overflow yourself. Since python has been used a lot for machine learning and artificial intelligence that people group will be. Most aware of the opportunities presented by chat. GPT and are more likely to leave stack overflow for Chachi PT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I particularly liked...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I particularly liked some of the graphs that you could draw from the data. The grass were very insightful and told you a lot about the popularity of languages and the time frame is over which use of stack overload has increased and decreased. Overall it seems to indicate that use of stack overflow has decreased since around 2016 for all languages. This feels a little bit sad and it is not entirely clear why. Chat bots providing summarised programming. Advice did not really become popularly used in 20 1718 or 19.
&lt;img  src='/images/Machine_Learning/day_72_multi_graph.png'&gt;
I also really like today SQL API at the head of the python notebook. This allowed me to connect the latest data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I am new to Python Jupiter notebooks. These are really useful tools for exploring data. The opportunity to modify and change your code and have it all presented in one "and "document" seems extremely helpful&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Machine Learning"></category><category term="#Maths"></category><category term="#Reflections"></category></entry><entry><title>100 Days of python, Day 73 Pandas agregate</title><link href="n/00000017.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-06-16T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-03-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>clexp</name></author><id>tag:None,2023-06-16:n/00000017.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Exploring Pandas and Data science&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img  src='/images/Machine_Learning/day_72_graph1.png'&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;This was...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Wednesday, 73 of 100 days of python. This was an introduction to the aggregate function. We were looking at data from the Lego data sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I already knew...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fair amount of this was new to me, although now I was somewhat familiar with the python, Jupiter notebooks.
&lt;img  src='/images/Machine_Learning/day_73_lego_graph_one.png'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What was new...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This stretched my familiarity with the count function, the group by function, and also the aggregate function. Just looking at the arrangement of words in the python code does not tell me immediately what it is doing. The opportunity to experiment was helpful and instructive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also interesting to see some of the data about the Lego sets. It was instructive to see that Lego is not as old as I thought it was and at what time frame in history, Lego has had a surge in the number of sets available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I particularly liked...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was fascinating to see which sets were the oldest, which sets at the most number of parts and how the complexity of sets has increased over time.

The more I examine this, clearly the bigger field it becomes. This is not like teaching oneself watercolour. This is a large and rapidly growing and also changing field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that has been helpful is the podcasts. In the words of Graham Alcott, writer of the book "productivity ninja ", podcasts are today's information DJs. That is to say radio DJs filter and select great music. This saves you the time. With V plethora of information available, you need someone to DJ or highlight and select useful information. Podcasts do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Podcasts are often part of a community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a word that has come up again and again in discussions about success of open source projects. The python community is large and supportive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rust community is accepting and welcoming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I am listening to a podcast, then I have a foot in a community. (Maybe a toe.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you listen to the podcasts enough, then you get drawn into the community and may even attend meet ups. When you are in community you get support and advice and so a community can support you to learn. The main sites are cargo and hugging face. And there are some good podcasts, such as practical, AI and TWIML.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Machine Learning"></category><category term="#Reflections #Machine_Learning"></category></entry><entry><title>What was my world saying in 1998</title><link href="n/what%20do%20I%20recall%20from%201998.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-05-06T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-05-06T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>clexp</name></author><id>tag:None,2016-05-06:n/what do I recall from 1998.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;What was happening in 1997 and 8&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;1997, I was studying A-levels. We had to pick university courses. This was the great bellyaching of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we make life decisions with out any feel for where we want to go?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One interesting approach to this problem was to ask what other people were doing. But the usefulness of this information for deciding a possible future was limited. On one hand, these people all made good decisions. On the other hand you would be choosing what they choose, they could now become your competition, and they were competitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my year, two boys, both with the same name, picked artificial intelligence to study. They even picked it at the same university.I was just imagining the headache. This would cause the admissions tutor. One of these boys was very sporty. The other was quite the opposite. What they had in common was maths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recall thinking this would be an unsolvable problem, but that it would be a significant problem when solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About that time I was watching a lot of Star Trek. As were many of my friends I was taken with the android. Data, the man-made humanoid robot. It was an interesting exploration of consciousness in artificial form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won an award for progress the year before, and the price was a book token. While in Meyer bookstore, my dad suggested I read a book by the title "the Emperor's new mind "by Roger Penrose. My dad was aware that Roger Penrose was the mathematical comrades in arms to know less than Stephen Hawking. So I purchased the book and tried to read it. I was 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book was several hundred pages long I made two attempts to read it over the subsequent 18 months. I reached around page 120 on both attempts. At time of writing, it has gone back on the reading list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming back to my peers who were going to study artificial intelligence, I thought with amusement about what the future that might hold. I was going to study mechanical engineering. Mechanical engineering is one of the industries with the earliest and oldest Institute. The head office is in the august position of being on St James's Park. It would have been on the route of the King from Buckingham Palace to Parliament and the King would have stopped there on his way to open Parliament and give a speech about industry and the year ahead. How was artificial intelligence of today (2024) comparable to that (1900s) as a future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had Windows 98, and were dreaming up creations on par with Commander Data. The gap was huge. Unfillable, so a carreer was not visible on the horizon in this industry.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Machine Learning"></category><category term="#Reflections #Machine_Learning"></category></entry></feed>
