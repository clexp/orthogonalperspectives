I almost didn't get to do A-levels. At a high performing school that makes you do maths a year early you can be made to run too quickly too fast and failed to make the great to get in where you might actually have some strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had two teachers of maths. This was beneficial. We were able to cover different material and have different teaching styles. I like my maths that it was small and focused and actually I was a strong candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think my school learnt at self to teaching maths to high level, but you had to be a certain type of person. The matter leads, of which I was not one really seem to understand the parlance very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've all my A-levels maths first one has prepared prepared me for everything else, the best. I certainly do regret not doing double maths, but for me at that time it was not an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='row'&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align='right' src="#"&gt;
In the end maths was my one a grade. I was quite sad about this. Getting an a in the physics seemed so straightforward. I was surprised that I got a B. In the chemistry I Gotta be I was less surprised about this but also I was quite annoyed.

Looking back on it, the problem with physics and chemistry is both of them required using English language, my native language. Earlier on in my school career, my secondary school had chosen to offer me extra English lessons instead of Latin. My parents have gone with the Latin. The English department was right English was not my strength. I still scored bees but it wasn't the A's that my friend scored.

On reflection, as I doubt it on reflection as an adult, my sentence construction was clumsy wordy and overly complicated. This meant in the one sentence physics and chemistry exam answers. I was prone to write something that was not precise or specific enough. I also had this idea that to demonstrate understanding you had to express the concept in different terms. I became very frustrated with people who could parrot recite phrases and get full marks. I felt it demonstrated no understanding. I missed the point that using a different explanation would be using imprecise terms and therefore might not actually be correct. I fully understood the physics and chemistry. I just was not playing the examination game.

Again later on in life, I came to find this was a feature of my marginal Neurodivergent.

&lt;p&gt;The Python community is huge and there are key luminaries in it. Michael Driscoll made an exercise of interviewing a dozen also key Python figures and including the interviews in a book. Being an outsider to the community this gave me a great insight into who the players are what they're interests are and what Python can do in its entirety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also gave me some great insight about where people feel Python is going to go, and some history about where Python has come from and the difficulty with the change from Python 2 to Python three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I already knew...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually knew very little about the Python community at large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What was new...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned a little bit about the backstory behind all of the characters leading the Python world. Some of them were a little bit like me and some really weren't this was both encouraging and also mind opening. I learned that everyone can contribute, and when everyone does, we are all the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I particularly liked...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asking these key figures about their personal interests and what they like and where they want to go was really interesting. There are some great players with some great ideas and great ability to outwork them. I feel that Python has a great future and I'm really pleased that I read this book.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Literature"></category></entry><entry><title>The Pragmatic Programmer, by Dave Thomas and Andrew Hunt</title><link href="n/12/Jul/23-17:07:63.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-07-12T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-07-12T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>clexp</name></author><id>tag:None,2023-07-12:n/12/Jul/23-17:07:63.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Maintaining a sense of balance, proportion and professionalism&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;This was...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had listened to an interview with the authors about their approach to programming being pragmatic and why they felt this was important to be learned by programmers. I was keen to explore my programming behaviours over and above learning loops and conditionals. I put this book on my wish list and when nobody bought it, I bought it for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the content of the book is entirely reflected by the title and then also a little bit more. There are often decisions, design decisions and software decisions, even human interface decisions where the decision needs to be pragmatic over correct. Humans do not operate ideally, and we need to take account of this. The book goes beyond this and talks about applying professionalism to programming and developing tradecraft. It speaks about exploring deeply one area and honing the skill to Craftsmanship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I already knew...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;having walked in the professional world both as a mechanical engineer and as a medic professionalism is not near to me. Learning how it applies in the career of programming is really interesting to see and there's lots of translations from my previous experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What was new...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were several situations where I can loosely summarise the writing as saying don't let the great be the enemy of the good. This is to say perfect may well take a long time to implement and not give you the outputs for your use case. Good enough may actually be better in that the effort has been focused on the majority case and the end use your experience is better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I particularly liked...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt the discussive and interesting tone, along with references to experience made the text come alive and it was fun to read. As I read it, I felt I was walking alongside the authors and learning from their stories.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Literature"></category><category term="#Programming"></category></entry><entry><title>Exercism, Python track, REST API</title><link href="n/100.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-07-02T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-07-02T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>clexp</name></author><id>tag:None,2023-07-02:n/100.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Super difficult JSON writer&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html"></content><category term="Python"></category></entry><entry><title>Deepmind Podcast with Hannah Fry, AI for sins</title><link href="n/44.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-07-02T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-07-02T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>clexp</name></author><id>tag:None,2023-07-02:n/44.html</id><summary type="html"></summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;this is a podcast&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Podcasts"></category></entry><entry><title>Big 0 and notation</title><link href="n/57.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-07-02T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-07-02T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>clexp</name></author><id>tag:None,2023-07-02:n/57.html</id><content type="html"></content><category term="Programming"></category></entry><entry><title>Exercism, Python track</title><link href="n/61.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-07-02T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-07-02T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>clexp</name></author><id>tag:None,2023-07-02:n/61.html</id><summary type="html"></summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;https://exercism.org/tracks/python/exercises&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an introduction to graph theory from the basics. It was nice to have a walk-through what is a graph with simple basic rules, and exercises at the end of each section. My brother advised I read this book with a notebook in hand, and so I did. He was right during things graphically made things much easier to understand. I didn't do all of the exercises but I did do some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I already knew...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew that graphs were made of nodes and edges and can be in two or three dimensional space however this is not a feature of recording graphs. Computer computers often will not have any dimensional representation of graphs besides a list of notes and edges. This was not a very long book, but it did take some time to get through it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What was new...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book was very revealing and gave me some great solutions to some programming problems when I worked through the Python track on the exorcism website. I am beginning to see how graph theory provides a solution to a number of problems, both in the physical world and with data handling. I have listened to some podcasts about graph databases, and knowledge graphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I particularly liked...&lt;/h2&gt;

But it helps when I am looking at new projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The itch&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted some sort of dictation tool that I can speak freely into. I wanted it to behave like a keyboard. This means I can use it anywhere. I speak into it and it sends a string of characters just like a keyboard. I have learnt this is possible using the key remapper. I have seen that the dictation is possible on the desktop. I wondered if I could have some sort of dictation and set that would simply send characters to the USB port. This would improve brackets possibly) the dictation speed and would not be bound in the same way that Microsoft Word is. Namely, cutting and pasting between documents. It could also be trained on my voice as I would take it with me. It would not be in the cloud so I would have no patient data concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What's out there.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are lots of dictation services out there. Here are a few bullet list analyst AI lexicon. But are there any IOT projects. Well, recently open AI released whisper. This is a local only speech recognition tool. It was then re-compiled to a C++ module so it can run on a CPU chip, not a GPU. The YouTube videos indicate people get good results with this. There is some indication it has even been run on a raspberry pie. So now there are hardware options, software, options, and more. It seems a few people have even done this themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite a few of the tools out there are limited to 2 or 300 words. This is not quite what I want if I am doing medical dictation. However, the range of speech is comparatively limited compared to full English. And the device would not need to be universally trained on my voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, whisper is built on many (30?) Layers of transformers. However, it now seems you can use, just two layers with some other architectural layers instead. Having listened to this podcast, TWIML, I might be able to get higher speed and higher accuracy with a different model. But where is this model?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Project"></category><category term="#dictationPI"></category><category term="#IOT"></category><category term="#edge"></category></entry><entry><title>UK A Level Maths review, Pure Maths 2</title><link href="n/00000005.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-06-16T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-03-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>clexp</name></author><id>tag:None,2023-06-16:n/00000005.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;UK A Level Maths review, Pure Maths 2&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;This was...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was pure to year two of the A-level maths on Udemy by Woody Lowenstein
&lt;img  src='/images/Maths/pure2_partial_fractions.jpg'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I already knew...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have covered a level maths before and so I knew a good deal of this. The maths I did previously was a little thin, having covered smaller levels of pure maths. This particular chapter was enormous. It covered huge amounts of differentiation and integration.
&lt;img  src='/images/Maths/pure2_trig_addition.jpg'&gt;
There was substantial commitment behind achieving this. We covered huge areas.
&lt;img  src='/images/Maths/p2_harmonic.jpg'&gt;
You should see the link above. There were a substantial number of areas all of which were covered to substantial depth. While I knew some differentiation and integration, the depth that was substantial. The chapter also covered a significant amount of trigonometry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What was new...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The differentiation covered a number of tools for performing differentials of complex functions. Equally, the integration chapter covered, a large number of tools for integrating complex functions and overlapped substantially with trigonometry and binomial expansion. It took quite some time to cover this. The integration chapter alone is four hours.
&lt;img  src='/images/Maths/p2_implicit_differentiation.jpg'&gt;
There is a chapter on parametric equations. I do not recall this at all from A-level maths in 1998.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is however clear that this is part of machine learning and artificial intelligence. This was a nice opening introduction. There was also a section on three-dimensional vectors. This was an extension on two-dimensional vectors from year one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I particularly liked...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img  src='/images/Maths/p2_int_by_parts.jpg'&gt;
I particularly liked how the different chapter areas overlapped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woody has chosen wisely in the order of material and how it is presented. The strength again was the short video followed by the short exercise to reinforce it. This was a great course and I cannot recommend it enough.

&lt;p&gt;This was the Udemy A-level maths PE course for year one or a S level by Woody Lowenstein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I already knew...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have completed A-level maths before. That was when I was 18 and at time of writing this I am 43, so 25 years ago. Since then I've used substantial maths on my engineering degree, much less maths as an engineering practitioner and almost no maths in my medicine career.
&lt;img  src='/images/Maths/p1_integration.jpg'&gt;
None of the material is new to me, but this was completely a refresher. I worked through all of the questions and all of the past papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What was new...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the methods were new to me, and clearly were the starting grounds for some of the higher concepts. You need today in machine learning. There was some useful information about binomial expansion is some new material on trigonometry and a good introduction to vectors.
&lt;img  src='/images/Maths/p1_trig.jpg'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I particularly liked...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I particularly liked the material covering natural log and logarithm graphs. While this was not knew it was covered very well. I would very strongly commend this course. Woodys style is clear and engaging, and also to the point. The short model of a little lecture, followed by a little practice was great at reinforcing the material. I think it is 2nd to none.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Maths"></category><category term="#Maths"></category><category term="#Reflections"></category></entry><entry><title>UK A Level Maths review, Mechanical Maths 1</title><link href="n/00000007.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-06-16T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-03-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>clexp</name></author><id>tag:None,2023-06-16:n/00000007.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;UK A Level Maths review, Mechanical Maths 1&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;This was...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was the Udemy A-level course by Woody Lowenstein covering mechanics 14AS. Maths&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I already knew...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a Masters degree in engineering, this was all very basic. It was fun to go back through it and be reminded what the basics were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What was new...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the A-level courses by Woody Owen Stein, he uses a Casio FX991EX class quiz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was some really nice teaching on how to use this. The Casio manuals are a little bit heavy going and not clear what and why and when.
&lt;img  src='/images/Maths/Mech1_forces.jpg'&gt;
Woodies, instructions and indications were excellent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the lecture would've used the emulator for the calculator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems to work on Windows. I struggle to get this to work on the Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was not able to get a VM that would've run it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img  src='/images/Maths/Mech1_variable_acc.jpg'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I particularly liked...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woody had a nice Mnemonic for learning the equations of constant acceleration. I recall having made mistakes by not using these equations correctly in the past.

&lt;h2&gt;I already knew...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a mechanical engineer, very little is new here. My goal is to learn machine learning and artificial intelligence and at time of writing I have chosen not to pursue this particular video series. I did complete the mechanics one series and felt it added nothing to the knowledge required for machine learning. With a tight time, I will park the mechanics two for another time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What was new...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't comment here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I particularly liked...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot comment here, however, if this is like any of Woodies other videos, the delivery style and pattern of short lecture, followed by exercise is excellent and 2nd to none.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Maths"></category><category term="#Maths"></category><category term="#Reflections"></category></entry><entry><title>UK A Level Maths review, Statistical Maths 1</title><link href="n/00000009.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-06-16T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-03-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>clexp</name></author><id>tag:None,2023-06-16:n/00000009.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;UK A Level Maths review, Statistical Maths 1&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;This was...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the statistics, one or year, one A-level or AS maths on Udemy by Woody Lowenstein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I already knew...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I have done A-level maths previously, my statistical maths was somewhat watered-down at the time. Since then I have done almost no statistical maths during my engineering degree. During medicine, there were nominal approaches to medical statistics, but even with my mathematical ability being better than my peers, this was mostly wasted on me.
&lt;img  src='/images/Maths/stats_one.jpg'&gt;
This was a great opening, introduction to understanding and appreciating data sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What was new...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days the A-levels seem to provide you with data sets. When you are in the exam you are expected to have familiarity with a dataset that you have been presented with in the months previously to the exam. This means you need to have familiarity with the missing data. Tobias is the averages and the standard deviations. While you do not need to recall any numerical facts out right, it helps to have a feel for the dataset.
&lt;img  src='/images/Maths/stats_one_bayes.jpg'&gt;
I thought this was great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woody prevent presents you with data sets from no less than four examining boards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He takes some time to walk through the key features of which you should be aware. At the time of completing this, I felt I would really go and complete the A-level exam.
&lt;img  src='/images/Maths/stats_one_binomial_distribution.jpg'&gt;
This is unnecessary on a pathway to learn machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a great basic introduction to the simple tools for analysing data set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I particularly liked...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, the delivery style was excellent. Further the pattern of short video followed by exercises really stimulated drawing as much as you could from the course. The examination samples were good and the examples worked. Examples were excellent.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Maths"></category><category term="#Maths"></category><category term="#Reflections"></category></entry><entry><title>Book review, Goedel Escher Bach, by Douglas Hofstadter</title><link href="n/00000011.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-06-16T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-07-12T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>clexp</name></author><id>tag:None,2023-06-16:n/00000011.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Book review, Goedel Escher Bach&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;This was...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book originally came to fame in the 90s. Now 20 years later due to the rise in artificial intelligence this book has become of conversation and interest again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, the author makes reference to systems that refer to themselves. He sees this pattern in the work of Gole Asha and Bach. Gole makes some mathematical statements which refer to versions of themselves, Escher similar makes self referencing images, and bark appears to make musical patterns which reference parts of themselve&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since humans are able to reference to themselves where we do not see this elsewhere the author suggests that self referencing is a key function of artificial intelligence. While he spots that these systems are not intelligent he implies self reference may be emergent from a complex system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I already knew...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had made thoughts about how humans are pattern recognising systems, recognising patterns within and without and overlapping each other, that intelligence was about pattern recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Author reading 'Godel Escher Bach'" src="/images/Literature/GEBscale.JPG" title="A heavy going read"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this is not widely stated, it is clear that matrix maths enables pattern recognition much more effectively than other systems. We are of course neural networks which are functionally Matrix maths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What was new...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned a lot about Godel, Escher and Bach, And had more food for thought about understanding what is intelligence when it is synthetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I particularly liked...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book carries conversations between a tortoise and a hair and in dialogue makes an entertaining description of the underlying points. If this Whitey home is too much for you, you might go a considerable way to understanding it simply by reading the comedy dialogues between these two characters.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Literature"></category><category term="#Maths"></category><category term="#Reflections"></category><category term="#books"></category></entry><entry><title>Book review, Mathematics for AI, by Tividar Danke</title><link href="n/00000012.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-06-16T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-03-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>clexp</name></author><id>tag:None,2023-06-16:n/00000012.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Book review, Mathematics for AI, by Tividar Danke&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;This was...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book was a few years in the making and it was released in stages. It covers the maths to some depth and the author explains key points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I already knew...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was already familiar with some of the basic linear algebra, and also some of the calculus. This material was denser and harder to go through. I didn't complete the whole book, but then I haven't had all of the chapters yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What was new...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was not familiar with some of the probability theory, but machine learning is Glorified statistics and Inference might be better described as statistical guessing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="New Clothes" src="/images/Literature/NewMind.JPG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;This was...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roger Penrose was maths comrade in arms to Stephen Hawking. This means they challenged each other's maths during their careers. This would be like a sparring partner but for mathematics. This book is Roger Penrose argument that there will never be true artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many authors in this area do he began by exploring cheering machines, chaos theory and number theory. The book is quite dense and it took me three attempts to work through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I already knew...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was already aware of some basic number theory, some basic chaos theory and the arguments surrounding artificial intelligence. The exploration of these topics I felt was probably deeper than they really needed to be and the pros was a little heavier than it had to be. However, the work is a thorough exploration of the premises leading to the conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What was new...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It felt satisfying to be told that that would never be artificial intelligence in the sense that we see human like behaviour and speech with a full self-awareness as we see on the television. It made me feel unique as a human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the most advanced large language models currently are at the end of the day just statistical guessing tools and do not have self-awareness as such. They often speak in the first person but this is a result of statistical guessing, and not an outcome of self-awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a counterpoint I might propose that since I am a neural network and large language models are artificial neural networks what then is the difference? If they are statistical guessing tools, then am I not to also a statistical guessing tool?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chief defence is that I know for sure that I have self-awareness. But again the counterpoint of this is that some animals also appear to have some level of self-awareness, yet also some humans fail to truly demonstrate a reflective and self-aware ability? This is to say that biological neural networks have a broad range which overlaps with the output we see from artificial neural networks that are large language models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I particularly liked...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tone of the text has a gentle excitability and mild opinionatedness which both contribute to the voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It still, however, is a very weighty tome and took me three attempts to complete.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Literature"></category><category term="#Maths"></category><category term="#Reflections"></category><category term="#Artificial_Intelligence"></category></entry><entry><title>100 Days of python, Day 71 Pandas</title><link href="n/00000015.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-06-16T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-03-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>clexp</name></author><id>tag:None,2023-06-16:n/00000015.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Exploring Pandas and Data science&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;![https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/learn/lecture/22371134#overview]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;This was...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a review of day 71 on the hundred days of python course through Udemy. This was a review of how to use panders from earlier lectures and chapters. We covered the basics of loading some data and exploring it with the pedestals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I already knew...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was simply revision. There was very little new here. It is a little tricky becoming familiar with the pandas syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What was new...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Anders syntax can be a little tricky. It is not always clear with Meyer. I should use the object model or whether I should use the dictionary model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the data frame is an object, there are lots of powerful features to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img  src='/images/Machine_Learning/day_71_output.png'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I particularly liked...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this lecture, we covered a range of college majors and their subsequent earning potential. It was not a surprise that computer engineering was one of the better paid salaries. At 43, it does make me consider my life choices. While I am paid very well I can't help feeling like there are other good options.
&lt;img  src='/images/Machine_Learning/day_71_code.png'&gt;
This also affected how I feel about my children's future. They are open to choose whatever they want to do, but I can't help but want to nudge them in a direction.

&lt;p&gt;This was the 72 in the hundred days of python from Udemy. This was a really good refresher of how to use Matlab to draw graphs of different types. It was useful to see some good examples of how to format and shape the graph and the images. It was also useful to see some trailing data function&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I already knew...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refresher of Matt plot lip functions was helpful
&lt;img  src='/images/Machine_Learning/day_72_graph1.png'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What was new...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insights from the data were quite interesting. It's surprising to see Java has decreased in the number of stack overflow posts since about 2015. It seems most programming languages on stack. Overflow have also decreased from around the 2015 to 16 era.
&lt;img  src='/images/Machine_Learning/day_72_pivot.png'&gt;
Peter on the other hand, has continued to escalate during that timeThe time that this chapter was written python was continuing to increase. Since this tutorial is written, have a Python seems to have decreased somewhat. All of the programming languages have decreased a bit, but python has decreased a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python is still with the head of the others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's difficult to know why this is. I wonder if people are mainly using chat GPT instead of stack overflow. Since stack overflow has been fed into chat. GPT you can probably get quicker answers than wading through stack. Overflow yourself. Since python has been used a lot for machine learning and artificial intelligence that people group will be. Most aware of the opportunities presented by chat. GPT and are more likely to leave stack overflow for Chachi PT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I particularly liked...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I particularly liked some of the graphs that you could draw from the data. The grass were very insightful and told you a lot about the popularity of languages and the time frame is over which use of stack overload has increased and decreased. Overall it seems to indicate that use of stack overflow has decreased since around 2016 for all languages. This feels a little bit sad and it is not entirely clear why. Chat bots providing summarised programming. Advice did not really become popularly used in 20 1718 or 19.

I also really like today SQL API at the head of the python notebook. This allowed me to connect the latest data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I am new to Python Jupiter notebooks. These are really useful tools for exploring data. The opportunity to modify and change your code and have it all presented in one "and "document" seems extremely helpful&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Machine Learning"></category><category term="#Maths"></category><category term="#Reflections"></category></entry><entry><title>100 Days of python, Day 73 Pandas agregate</title><link href="n/00000017.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-06-16T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-03-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>clexp</name></author><id>tag:None,2023-06-16:n/00000017.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Exploring Pandas and Data science&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img  src='/images/Machine_Learning/day_72_graph1.png'&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;This was...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Wednesday, 73 of 100 days of python. This was an introduction to the aggregate function. We were looking at data from the Lego data sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I already knew...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fair amount of this was new to me, although now I was somewhat familiar with the python, Jupiter notebooks.
&lt;img  src='/images/Machine_Learning/day_73_lego_graph_one.png'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What was new...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This stretched my familiarity with the count function, the group by function, and also the aggregate function. Just looking at the arrangement of words in the python code does not tell me immediately what it is doing. The opportunity to experiment was helpful and instructive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also interesting to see some of the data about the Lego sets. It was instructive to see that Lego is not as old as I thought it was and at what time frame in history, Lego has had a surge in the number of sets available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I particularly liked...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was fascinating to see which sets were the oldest, which sets at the most number of parts and how the complexity of sets has increased over time.

&lt;p&gt;This is the all-time classic introduction book to Python and is where I started. I listen to a podcast interview featuring Eric Mathis, who is a teacher. He described learning programming as best done through projects and in this book he gives you three projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first project you use play game to create a simple arcade space invaders game. This helped me explore the game loop graphic boundaries, high scores and edge cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second project was the use of Matt plot Lib and Webb API is to explore probabilities and statistics. I learned about application programming interfaces graph representation using plot and Matt plot live we also covered installing and loading, separated value data and a dose of probability. This was a nice exploration of additional topics above the opening chapters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third project was writing of a learning log using the Django Python web framework by the time I got to this I had already explored the pelican python static blog to it and also SQL alchemy, ginger to templating and Flask. I did not complete this chapter but would love to go back just for the learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I already knew...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came to Python mainly knowing some C+ plus having worked through."jumping into C++"by Alex Allain. This previous work taught me a good deal about pointers references, loop structures and important programming basics such as modules, imports and other basic structures. This means when I came to Python and found I did not need to use pointers. I still understood what was going on in the background. I was aware of the need to allocate and delicate memory and what the difference was between a shallow and a deep copy. I feel this substantially improved what I could get from this basic Python introduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What was new...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I certainly learnt more about using list slices. I learned a bit about using pie game and also Matt plot Lib, plot Lee. I would like to go back and complete the Django work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I particularly liked...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really liked that. This was a straightforward project based introduction to programming in Python. Note that this was before large language models so all the basic mistakes and error solving I did on my own. I feel this gave me an advantage in learning Python.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Literature"></category><category term="#Maths"></category><category term="#Reflections"></category><category term="#books"></category><category term="#Python"></category></entry><entry><title>Book review</title><link href="n/00000026.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-06-16T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-03-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>clexp</name></author><id>tag:None,2023-06-16:n/00000026.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Book review, Mission Python, by Sean McManus&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;This was...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a great tutorial book that taught me about some Python and was a great tool as I worked through it with my son. I used it as an exercise in teaching Python to him. I do not think he would be able to code in Python as he can still barely type, however we demonstrated that we can arrange instructions to perform computer game behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I already knew...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was already familiar with a large body of Python code having completed other books and online courses. This really explored the application of those learnings. There was also a really useful graphic set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What was new...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had not used pygame before this. I learned about window handling sounds and events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I particularly liked...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expectation in the book was that you would copy and type out all of the code. Programmers of past often site this as one of the main ways of learning programming. I think in the years ahead typing out programs in this way we'll just no longer be done by trainees. This means the future cohort of programmers will be different by nature to those in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even I in this code, use the code from The Hub repo. We made some changes here and there to demonstrate that we could control elements in the game to our own wishes and plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this speaks to the nature of the changing landscape of software development currently and in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Literature"></category><category term="#Maths"></category><category term="#Reflections"></category><category term="#Python"></category><category term="#books"></category></entry><entry><title>Kaggle Tutorial Intermediate Machine Learning</title><link href="n/00000031.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-06-16T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-03-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>clexp</name></author><id>tag:None,2023-06-16:n/00000031.html</id><summary type="html"></summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;This was...&lt;/h2&gt;

A lot of people say it's not like maths in that it is language. It is a language but it's also like maths.

&lt;p&gt;$$ \int{2x^2 - x + 6 }dx$$
Languages are vague. Lots of meanings of different uses for different people. Two people speaking, the same language can mean different things. But with programming languages, it's explicit. There is no opportunity for ambiguity, in natural language it is inevitable, and even deliberately used as normal practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans are linguists.  We think in language, we write in language, we communicate in language. We are language machine. Humans also like there to be a clear difference between true and false. Perhaps that's the real reason reason we made computers binary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the real world doesn't give us a difference between true and false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programming does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programming is like language that we might use all the time. But programming is like maths, either work or they don't, there's only two outcomes. It's the perfect union of what I'm built for, language, but also what I like - certainty. Either you're certainly right, or you're certainly wrong. Only two outcomes.

&lt;p&gt;One thing that has been helpful is the podcasts. In the words of Graham Alcott, writer of the book "productivity ninja ", podcasts are today's information DJs. That is to say radio DJs filter and select great music. This saves you the time. With V plethora of information available, you need someone to DJ or highlight and select useful information. Podcasts do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Podcasts are often part of a community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a word that has come up again and again in discussions about success of open source projects. The python community is large and supportive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rust community is accepting and welcoming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I am listening to a podcast, then I have a foot in a community. (Maybe a toe.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you listen to the podcasts enough, then you get drawn into the community and may even attend meet ups. When you are in community you get support and advice and so a community can support you to learn. The main sites are cargo and hugging face. And there are some good podcasts, such as practical, AI and TWIML.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Machine Learning"></category><category term="#Reflections #Machine_Learning"></category></entry><entry><title>What was my world saying in 1998</title><link href="n/what%20do%20I%20recall%20from%201998.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-05-06T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-05-06T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>clexp</name></author><id>tag:None,2016-05-06:n/what do I recall from 1998.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;What was happening in 1997 and 8&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;1997, I was studying A-levels. We had to pick university courses. This was the great bellyaching of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we make life decisions with out any feel for where we want to go?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One interesting approach to this problem was to ask what other people were doing. But the usefulness of this information for deciding a possible future was limited. On one hand, these people all made good decisions. On the other hand you would be choosing what they choose, they could now become your competition, and they were competitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my year, two boys, both with the same name, picked artificial intelligence to study. They even picked it at the same university.I was just imagining the headache. This would cause the admissions tutor. One of these boys was very sporty. The other was quite the opposite. What they had in common was maths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recall thinking this would be an unsolvable problem, but that it would be a significant problem when solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About that time I was watching a lot of Star Trek. As were many of my friends I was taken with the android. Data, the man-made humanoid robot. It was an interesting exploration of consciousness in artificial form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won an award for progress the year before, and the price was a book token. While in Meyer bookstore, my dad suggested I read a book by the title "the Emperor's new mind "by Roger Penrose. My dad was aware that Roger Penrose was the mathematical comrades in arms to know less than Stephen Hawking. So I purchased the book and tried to read it. I was 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book was several hundred pages long I made two attempts to read it over the subsequent 18 months. I reached around page 120 on both attempts. At time of writing, it has gone back on the reading list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming back to my peers who were going to study artificial intelligence, I thought with amusement about what the future that might hold. I was going to study mechanical engineering. Mechanical engineering is one of the industries with the earliest and oldest Institute. The head office is in the august position of being on St James's Park. It would have been on the route of the King from Buckingham Palace to Parliament and the King would have stopped there on his way to open Parliament and give a speech about industry and the year ahead. How was artificial intelligence of today (2024) comparable to that (1900s) as a future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had Windows 98, and were dreaming up creations on par with Commander Data. The gap was huge. Unfillable, so a carreer was not visible on the horizon in this industry.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Machine Learning"></category><category term="#Reflections #Machine_Learning"></category></entry></feed>
