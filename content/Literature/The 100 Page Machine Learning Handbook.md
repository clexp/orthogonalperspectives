Summary: Book review, The 100 Page Machine Learning Handbook, by Andriy Burkov
Status: published

## This was...

This is a small and light book which covers all of the basic fields of machine learning maths. To achieve this, it does it succinctly and lightly using dense mathematical notation.

## I already knew...

I already knew some of the basic calculus, but the methods described here were largely new to me.

## What was new...

Everything from regression to support vector machines to deep learning. Reading this book requires some attention so it's not bedtime reading. I would recommend taking notes if you are reading through this and possibly implementing some code that does some of these. You will find Python libraries for some of this.

## I particularly liked...

I like it that the vast field of machine learning can be covered in such a light book. This was still quite succinct and dense.
