# About Chris Lewis

## Professional Background

I'm a Chartered Mechanical Engineer and General Practitioner (Family Doctor) with a passion for applying data science and machine learning to real-world problems. My career spans engineering, medicine, and technology, giving me unique perspectives on how AI can transform both healthcare and industrial applications.

## Engineering Foundation

My journey began with a Mechanical Engineering degree in the late 1990s, where I developed expertise in:
- **Thermodynamics and fluid dynamics** - Analyzing steam turbine performance and plant efficiency
- **Materials science** - Testing metal properties under various temperature and load conditions
- **Project management** - Leading plant installation and reliability projects
- **Data analysis** - Processing live and historical thermodynamic data for performance optimization

I achieved Chartered Engineer status with the Institute of Mechanical Engineers, working in chemical engineering where I gained experience in corporate governance, health and safety law, operations management, and risk assessment.

## Medical Practice

After engineering, I pursued medicine and became a General Practitioner (Family Doctor). This transition brought:
- **Clinical decision-making** - Applying evidence-based medicine in primary care
- **Patient-centered care** - Understanding the human factors in healthcare delivery
- **Healthcare systems** - Experience with NHS operations and patient pathways
- **Preventive medicine** - Focus on early intervention and health promotion

## Technology and AI Focus

My current work combines all three domains:
- **Python and Data Science** - Building analytical tools for both engineering and medical applications
- **Machine Learning** - Developing models for predictive analytics and pattern recognition
- **Algorithm Design** - Creating efficient solutions for complex problems
- **Home Automation** - Building IoT systems and smart infrastructure

## Current Projects

I'm actively working on:
- **Medical AI applications** - Exploring how machine learning can enhance diagnostic accuracy and patient care
- **Engineering AI** - Applying predictive maintenance and optimization algorithms to industrial systems
- **Educational content** - Sharing knowledge through this blog and other platforms
- **Green infrastructure** - Building sustainable systems at home and studying climate science

## Teaching and Mentorship

I enjoy teaching my children through hands-on projects including:
- **Garden produce and sustainability**
- **DIY woodwork and engineering principles**
- **Arduino programming and electronics**
- **Python coding and computational thinking**

## Professional Philosophy

I believe in being a "doer of things" - someone who doesn't just theorize but implements solutions. My background in both engineering and medicine gives me a unique perspective on how technology can solve real-world problems while maintaining human-centered design principles.
