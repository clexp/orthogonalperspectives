Summary: A simple introduction to Bayesian Probability

### what is this?

This was an introduction to Beijing probability, by maths teacher Woody Lewenstein, on the Udemy platform. I found it to be a nice simple introduction to the early stages of Bayesian analysis.

For me, it followed on from the three statistics A-level modules, which Woody Lowenstein also provides on Udemy.

### who is it by?

Woody Lewenstein is a maths teacher who puts some of his teaching materials on the Udemy platform. See some of my other posts about them. They are pretty good comprehensive walk-through with worked examples and practice exercises. I recommend them as material to support A-level learning.

### what did I learn?

I learnt lots about the different roles of Bayesian probability, and how it is derived. This was relatively new to me but on reflection it is an area of probability that affects much of my work and has done throughout my life. Now I am able to put a name to this form of analysis and do it more formally.

### do I recommend it?

I absolutely would recommend this as a basic introduction to anyone with high school level maths. It walks you through the early stages and grounding in Bayesian probability and statistics.
