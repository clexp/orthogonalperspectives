## This was...

Was the Udemy A-level course by Woody Lowenstein covering mechanics 14AS. Maths

## I already knew...

With a Masters degree in engineering, this was all very basic. It was fun to go back through it and be reminded what the basics were.

## What was new...

Throughout the A-level courses by Woody Owen Stein, he uses a Casio FX991EX class quiz.

There was some really nice teaching on how to use this. The Casio manuals are a little bit heavy going and not clear what and why and when.

Woodies, instructions and indications were excellent.

In the lecture would've used the emulator for the calculator.

This seems to work on Windows. I struggle to get this to work on the Mac.

I was not able to get a VM that would've run it.

## I particularly liked...

Woody had a nice Mnemonic for learning the equations of constant acceleration. I recall having made mistakes by not using these equations correctly in the past. No more mistakes!
