  "content": "## This was...\n\nThis was a great tutorial book that taught me about some Python and was a great tool as I worked through it with my son. I used it as an exercise in teaching Python to him. I do not think he would be able to code in Python as he can still barely type, however we demonstrated that we can arrange instructions to perform computer game behaviours.\n\n## I already knew...\n\nI was already familiar with a large body of Python code having completed other books and online courses. This really explored the application of those learnings. There was also a really useful graphic set.\n\n## What was new...\n\nI had not used pygame before this. I learned about window handling sounds and events.\n\n## I particularly liked...\n\nThe expectation in the book was that you would copy and type out all of the code. Programmers of past often site this as one of the main ways of learning programming. I think in the years ahead typing out programs in this way we'll just no longer be done by trainees. This means the future cohort of programmers will be different by nature to those in the past.\n\nEven I in this code, use the code from The Hub repo. We made some changes here and there to demonstrate that we could control elements in the game to our own wishes and plans.\n\nI think this speaks to the nature of the changing landscape of software development currently and in the future.\n",
