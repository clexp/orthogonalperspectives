              <p>Having become familiar with using Arduino and raspberry pi, though to no substantial steps, I wanted to look at means of using dictation tools.</p>
<p>Through my work I have to make rapid data entry in English. For many in my line of work, this is a case of hammering away on the keyboard, this is error prone as you do not watch. Further research suggests that the quickest data entry is from touch typing so I learnt to touch type. This was hard work at 40 years old but I did it.</p>
<p>Not happy with the keyboards at work or even the frequent long stretches for the back space key I read about new keyboard layouts. It seemed there were some good options. New paragra working for a state corporate, there are strict rules about not going outside the provided ecosystem of software tools. On Windows, I could not use the alternative keyboard layout called Komack. I could not run a program off a USB stick to do key swapping either. This would be the IT service providers, nightmare. I did find a key mapper that sits between the keyboard and the computer. This allowed me to type in Commack and has qwerty signals arrive in the computer.</p>
<p>This meant purchasing a keyboard, I always felt conspicuous walking into a clinical setting with my own keyboard. But there were other advantages. The keyboard mouse keyboard manoeuvre with the hand was slow so purchasing a small keyboard was more comfortable. It also meant I could buy a small keyboard, but also a silent keyboard. This means touch typing while I am mid conversation is much more discrete.</p>
<p>But really, I liked the dictation service provided by the secretaries. I could write substantial notes in a short space of time and not think about it anymore.</p>
<p>I had used dictation tools back in 2002. I used Dragon simply speaking. It was not bad but had a word error rate somewhere between 60 and 80%. While this meant I could have a flow of thoughts it meant there was a knot in substantial editing time spend.</p>
<p>I began to look at other forms of dictation. I found there were some online services, but I could not use them. Even though they were able to meet GDPR regulations, I could not buy their services since I had to go through a remote and a massive IT department. It just was not worth the headache. 1</p>
<p>1 day when a machine was being updated. I commented about dictation services to the technician. He advised that Microsoft Word now had dictation tools. This was a real find.</p>
<p>The dictation tool here now 20 years later. I tried using it.</p>
<p>It is now 20 years since my first foray into, speech recognition. The Microsoft Word speech recognition is somewhere between 80 and 90%. Sometimes higher. I am referring to the word error rate. This can be quite good for very large volumes of text. It prefers to hear longer volumes of text as the prediction can be more accurate when it is in context. I cannot find whether you are supposed to staccato your speech or if you are supposed to speak freely but it seems to do better if you staccato the speech. Even for this blog, I used the inbuilt Apple speech recognition and have found it is better if you staccato the speech. I don't think this is how it is trained.</p>
<p>The goal of using the speech recognition is to reduce the time spent typing. If I am doing substantial editing, then I am not saving any time.</p>
<p>If I spend a lot of time then what was the point.</p>
<p>There is also a question about the dictation to blocking out rude words. Many of the medical words are in fact rude words in other contexts. For this reason, I am often having to type in the correct words where it is blocked out. In addition when I dictate I have to cut and paste the typed text from the Word document in to the clinical notes package. This at further time. I am still not sure whether it is worth it.</p>
<p>I do not know if it saves time, but it feels like it could be close. I do not think it is very accurate, but then I have not trained it to my voice and my selection of words.</p>
<p>I also have some concerns about using it since I do not know if it secretly takes the recordings and sent them to Microsoft speech recognition service for higher performance. Sometimes the fans on the desktop unit spin up so it could be local processing only. However, these are corporate desktop not machines and so I do not think they are GPU envy, and I am not sure they would use the GPU even if it had a good one. Also, the vans do not always spin up for speech recognition just in some instances it might have been that was a busy JavaScript running in a webpage I had open. I wanted more options.</p>
<p>For now I am typing on an atypical, Le keyboard layout on my own private keyboard. But I'm looking for other options.</p>
