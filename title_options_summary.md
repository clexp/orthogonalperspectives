## Key Considerations Discussed

### Concerns with "A Counterpoint":

- Not obviously about engineer/medic exploring ML/AI
- Commits to having contrarian views
- Similar to "Data Skeptic" podcast

### Concerns with "clexp asks why":

- Commits to Q&A format
- Requires Disqus system
- Locks into asking questions in every post

### Concerns with "Reveal the Why":

- Too close to mathematician's "yes but why" site
- Not obviously about engineer/medic exploring ML/AI

### Benefits of "Professional" in title:

- Frees up strapline space
- Clearly indicates professional background
- Flexible format commitment

## Current Favorite (Option 2):

- **Title:** "A Counterpoint"
- **Strapline:** "Three professional journeys, one consistent approach: viewing complex systems from the outside"

## Notes:

- All options use the same strapline about "three professional journeys"
- The strapline connects to Simon Sinek's "Start with Why" framework
- Need to avoid backing into stylistic corners
- Should be authentic to experience while employer-friendly
